# Lab1ArepMvnGit

## Laboratory 1

This project provides characteristics for calculating the mean and standard deviation in a data group.

I used my own implementation of a double LinkedList to store the data.

## LinkedList

A Double Linked List (DLL) contains an extra pointer, typically called previous pointer, together with next pointer and data which are there in singly linked list.

These LinkedList can store any type of Object and do operations like:

- Add an item at the end.
- Add an item in any position.
- Get any element from the linkedList.
- Get any node from the linkedList.
- Get the head node.
- Get the tail node.
- Know the number of items on the linkedList.
- Replace any item.
- Remove any element.
- Iterate on the linkedList.

## Test Cases

In the laboratory we have two test cases and the expected value of the mean and standard deviation.

Cases:

Expected values:

![expectedResutls](https://github.com/swilsonmelo/Lab1ArepMvnGit/blob/master/resources/img/expectedResutls.PNG)

Obtained values:

![results](https://github.com/swilsonmelo/Lab1ArepMvnGit/blob/master/resources/img/results.PNG)

We can see that the values obtained and those expected are the same, we can affirm that both the calculation of the mean and the calculation of the standard deviation are being done correctly.

## Running

Compile first time the project after downloaded.

    mvn package

Make unit tests.

    mvn test

To run the whole project.

    mvn exec:java -D "exec.mainClass"="edu.escuelaing.arep.ASE.app.calculator.App"

Generate documentation.

In order to obtain the documentation of the project, you must execute the command:

    mvn javadoc:jar

An HTML documentation will be generated in /target/site/apidocs/index.html
